# KNN-Classifier

### Here I created a KNN Classifier Model on sonar dataset and performed some experiments

#### I did this with using in-built model and without using in-built model just by math
#### I also did this for different k values and measured performance of each k value
#### Also done by using divide and conquer method i.e., 1st I performed on complete dataset and then I performed on dividing the dataset into subsets (5 parts and 6 parts). 
#### The evaluation of model is done without using any in-built functions in both the cases


#### The following folder contains the python code and dataset
